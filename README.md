![Dash is on the right-hand side](bokehvsdash.png)

A companion repository to [my article that compares Bokeh to Dash](https://blog.sicara.com/bokeh-dash-best-dashboard-framework-python-shiny-alternative-c5b576375f7f).

Instructions on how to run the code are in the article.

To deploy on Heroku use:

- For Bokeh: `git subtree push --prefix bokeh heroku-bokeh master`
- For Dash: `git subtree push --prefix dash heroku-dash master`
